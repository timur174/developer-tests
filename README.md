# NHLPA Developer Tests

This repo contains the source for both the [back](https://github.com/nhlpa/developer-tests/tree/master/HockeyApi) and [front](https://github.com/nhlpa/developer-tests/tree/master/JavaScriptAssessment) end NHLPA developer assessments. The projects are simple, but challenging take home tests, intended to assess core competencies within ASP.NET, SQL Server and JavaScript. Using external libraries is *not permitted* in either assessment.

## Server-side Assessment
A 3-on-3 hockey league is seeking a REST API to support their mobile app, for managing team rosters.
