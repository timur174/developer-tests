        <p>Why pepeCool, you ask? It's like asking why do we love puppies or why is pizza the best invention since the wheel.</p>
        <p>See, the name 'Pepe' represents the meme culture that practically built the internet. And when you combine it with 'Cool,' you're not just investing in a token, you're investing in a lifestyle.</p>
        <p>It's cooler than an Eskimo sipping iced tea in a snowstorm. It's the crypto-equivalent of a mic drop. Boom!</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>AI and memes. That's like Batman and Robin but for the digital age.</p>
        <p>We're pioneering the next frontier of crypto, where memes generated by top-of-the-line AI algorithms give you financial gains while you laugh your way to the bank.</p>
        <p>pepeCool isn't just a token, it's the future. A hilarious future, but the future nonetheless.</p>

    <section id="team">
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Our team is as unique as a snowflake but without the melting part. Let's start with Bob, our Chief Meme Officer.</p>
        <p>Bob knows memes like Einstein knew relativity. You show him an image; he shows you a meme masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Then there's Sally, the AI wizard. We're still not sure if she's a real person or an AI we accidentally created that gained sentience.</p>
        <p>We are basically the "Guardians of the Crypto Galaxy." Join us for a ride across the meme universe!</p>

        <h2>Road Map</h2>
        <p>We're not saying we're planning world domination, but if we were, here's how it would look:</p>
        <p>Q1: Assemble the team, preferably without a dramatic montage.</p>
        <p>Q2: Hit all the major exchanges, making pepeCool as accessible as cat videos on the internet.</p>
        <p>Q3: Unveil the AI-powered meme generator, because why not?</p>
        <p>Q4: Elevate community events, turning them into the Woodstock of crypto!</p>
