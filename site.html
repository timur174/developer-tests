        <p>Why pepeCool? That's like asking why the sky is blue or why dogs are better than cats (don't @ us, cat people).</p>
        <p>See, 'Pepe' is an iconic name in meme culture. If memes had a Mount Rushmore, Pepe would be on it. Now mix that with 'Cool,' and you get a cryptocurrency that's destined for stardom.</p>
        <p>We're talking moon landing-level fame, minus the conspiracy theories.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We're not just another crypto coin; we're a movement. And every great movement needs a greater idea.</p>
        <p>Enter AI-powered memes. That's right! Imagine a world where your memes are as smart as you are, where meme magic literally pays off. That's the pepeCool promise.</p>
        <p>If this doesn't sound like the dream for every millennial and Gen Z investor, then honestly, we don't know what is.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="team">
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Meet the Dream Team. We've got Bob, the meme whisperer. If memes were Pokemon, he'd be Ash Ketchum.</p>
        <p>Then there's Sally, who is so in tune with AI, we're not sure if she's part human or part code.</p>
        <p>We're like the Avengers of crypto, but cooler because we don't need a multiverse to sort out our issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="roadmap">
        <h2>Road Map</h2>
        <p>Q1 - It all begins. Just like the Big Bang, but for your wallet.</p>
        <p>Q2 - Exchanges galore! We're spreading faster than grandma's Sunday brunch gossip.</p>
        <p>Q3 - Meme revolution. Our AI will pop out memes like a Pez dispenser.</p>
        <p>Q4 - Community events that are more happening than your high school prom.</p>
